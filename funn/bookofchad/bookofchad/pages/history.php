It also includes an account of the history of mankind as shown in a vision to Ether by God, and translated by Moroni in the gold plates, and translated by an anonymous prophet-historian in the latter days by way of commandment.

	ChadGasm&trade; is a volume of holy scripture comparable to the Bible and is a sequel to The Book of Mormon. It is a record of God's dealings with the inhabitants of the Americas, both ancient and new, and contains the fulness of the everlasting gospel. The book was written by one man during his treacherous campaign to prevent the Savior's Second Coming. The Lord commanded the Prophet, Joseph Smith, not to translate from this sealed portion until the Gentiles hath repented of their iniquity and became clean before the Lord. <a title='"For the Lord said unto me: They shall not go forth unto the Gentiles until the day that they shall repent of their iniquity, and become clean before the Lord."'><code>Ether 4:6</code></a> However, it has come to pass that the iniquity of both Saints and Gentiles is so great, that in the Lord's wisdom, he hath declared it his own due time. <a title='"And the Lord said unto him: Write these things and seal them up; and I will show them in mine own due time unto the children of men."'><code>Ether 3:27</code></a>
	<br />
	The record gives an accurate account of the events which take place throughout the entirety of the history of mankind. And now, if there are faults they are the mistakes of men; wherefore, worry not that it includes a translation of a translation of an account of a vision. God hath proclaimed it as totally reliable information, and acceptable for the entertainment of His missionaries. Condemn not the things of God, that ye may be found spotless at the judgment-seat of Christ.

<h3>Privacy: How we collect and use information</h3>
What we collect
Privacy is a very serious issue whenever you have information stored in a database.  We have decided to not store any information in our database for security purposes.  The information we collect from the user in the case of purchasing an item includes:
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Age (if purchasing a Mature rated game)</li>
<li>Email Address</li>
<li>Physical Address (only if physical object is purchased)</li>
<li>Credit Card Information (only used for purchase and then discarded)</li>
</ul>
In the event of purchasing an electronic product (a game), the user must give a credit card number, expiration date and security code for purchase.  To prevent any incident, this information will not be stored in the database.  In the event of that game having a Mature rating, the user is required to disclose their age for legal reasons.
<h4>3rd party usage</h4>
<p>All pieces of information given by the user will be used purely for our site’s functions.  We will not give your information to any 3rd party at any time for any reason.  We will not use your information to send you any advertisements or notices concerning any issue that doesn’t relate to The Big Leagues.  We will not keep any of the details on file, so as a result, you will have to put in your information again if you wish to purchase products in the future.</p>
<p><strong><em>We will not be held responsible in the event of an underage person purchasing a Mature rated game.</em></strong>  You will be asked at the time of purchase of such a product if you are of legal age to be purchasing it.  If you are not 17 or older, and want to purchase an M rated game, and do so with a credit card, it's assumed that the purchaser has given consent to the recipient to purchase the game.</p>

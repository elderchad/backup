		<h2>CHAPTER 2</h2>
		<p><em>
		Chad arrives in Kirtland to find that Joseph married Fanny Alger, and Emma is pissed. Chad fucks the outraged Emma, and pays tithing to allow him to be baptized and enter the temple where Joseph is hidden away like a pussy. Young Joseph senses danger and the Temple goes into lockdown. A surprise awaits in the Holy of Holies. A.D. 1836.
		</em></p>
		<p>
		And it came to pass, that I, Chad, hath arrived in the settlement the Smitties called Kirtland. And the inhabitants thereof said many things unto me.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;2 NPC 1: 'Joseph is marrying my 14 year old daughter! I am so honored to have my lineage sealed to the prophet!'
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;3 NPC 2: 'I believe Joseph restored the true gospel, but he just married my wife. I feel like Job when he was being tested.'
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;4 NPC 3: 'I'm confused about why Joseph has never shown us the plates. We would never harm them! Sometimes God works in mysterious ways, I guess.'
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;5 NPC 4: 'Joseph is busy speaking with Elohim in the temple at the moment. You can't go in unless you're a tithe-paying member.'
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;6 NPC 5: 'If you wish to join us and visit the Temple, you can get a Tithing Slip from the Bishop of this town.'
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;7 Finding the Temple guarded by a mysterious shield, I therefore I went in search of the Bishop in order to obtain what is required to gain entrance and slay the Prophet.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;8 And it came to pass that the Bishop in his office hath told me: 'Welcome to our Kirtland ward, brother! If you would like to join our fold, you must first pay your Tithing to get baptized. Would you like to purchase your <span style='color: rgb(0, 162, 232);'>Tithing Slip</span> for 10 percent of your USDs now?'
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;9 And it came to pass that I paid forth what was required in order to keep double-agenting, and the Bishop hath led me to the baptismal font.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;10 Bishop: 'Chad, having been commissioned of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.'
		<br />
		
		&nbsp;&nbsp;11 And it came to pass that the Bishop dropped me in the water to cleanse all of my sins away, and he sayeth unto me, 'Brother Chad, welcome to our Smitty-club.'

		<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;13 And it came to pass that the Angel Moroni was in the Holy of Holies upon my arrival.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;14 And he spoke unto me, 'I'm sorry Chad, but our Prophet is in another Temple.'
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;15 And it came to pass that I called the Angel who doth calleth himself Moroni 'dumb and gay', for his righteousness was intensely getting under my skin, and I sleweth him.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;16 And it came to pass that I was rewarded for my deeds with a sacrament of bread and a key of the Holy Aaronic Priesthood.

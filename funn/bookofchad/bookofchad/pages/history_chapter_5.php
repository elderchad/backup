		<h2>CHAPTER 5</h2>
		<p><em>
		Chad arrives at Salt Lake City. He finds a new bustling town with more Smitties arriving every day. Everything is written in a strange language. Using the Urim and Thummim, he is able to decipher the wording to find his way to Brigham Young, known as 'the Lion of the Lord'. A.D. 1847.
		</em></p>
		<p>
		The sign outside of Salt Lake City reads, '<span class='deseret'>hOlEnes tU T lQrd</span>'
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;2 I awoke within an underground cavern. It was light as day inside, and I saw the glisten of a variety of wonderful treasures. Among them the Golden Plates, Breastplate, Liahona, and Sword of Laban.

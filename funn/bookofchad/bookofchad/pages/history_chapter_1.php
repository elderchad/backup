		<h2>CHAPTER 1</h2>
		<p><b>
		    The Latter Days
		</b></p>
		<p><em>
		Chad wakes up in a mysterious place. He goes in to Palmyra, and returns to the cave to get the Sword of Laban and the Golden Plates. He hears murmurs about Joseph Smith. He then heads towards Kirtland in hot pursuit. He meets Cain. A.D. 1830.
		</em></p>
		<p>
		Chad: 'What the fuck... Where am I?... I feel like shit...'
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;2 I awoke within an underground cavern. It was light as day inside, and I saw the glisten of a variety of wonderful treasures. Among them the Golden Plates, Breastplate, Liahona, and Sword of Laban.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;3 Greed was within my heart, but when I attempted to obtain these treasure for my own, I came to realize I was unable to obtain them. I needed sustenance.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;4 And it came to pass that I exited the cave, avoiding the dangers within.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;5 When I found a path to the sunlit surface, the beauty thereof was a figurative and literal breath of fresh air.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;6 And it came to pass that I found a dwelling within shouting distance of the cave. And the inhabitants thereof called this dwelling Palmyra.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;7 The inhabitants harbored ill-will towards a local boy by the name of Joseph Smith. This boy enraged the inhabitants with claims of speaking with God and translating a new scripture.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;8 And I shall record the things which the inhabitants of Palmyra spoke of.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;9 NPC 1: 'Will you destroy Joseph Smith and put an end to this nonsense?' A dark voice spoke from within me saying if I do not accept this, I shall surely perish on the spot and have to start my journey over.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;10 NPC 2: We already chased Joseph out of town. I hear he and his followers are settling in Kirtland. Find him there and destroy him for us. We will give you anything you wish if you do this for us.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;11 NPC 3: This Smith fellow is a bit out of his mind. Isn't it a bit curious that he was a treasure-hunter?
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;12 NPC 4: We all want answers to the big questions, but Joe's answer is odd...
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;13 It's not even original! Someone else wrote about that exact same theory of the origin of the Native Americans before him!
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;14 Within the homes I found what I had sought. The coffee and cigarettes boosted my energy and provided nourishment to my soul.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;15 And it came to pass that I, Chad, went back to the cave to obtain those glorious treasures for my own.

		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;16 And it came to pass that I, Chad, exited the cave and began my pursuit of the one they call Joseph Smith.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;17 And a little outside of that dwelling which is called Palmyra, I was approached by a large, tall, pitch-black and hairy man.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;18 He sayeth unto me: 'Waddup nigga? Is been a fuckin while since I seen you. I thought you fuckin died, man. How are things?'
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;19 And verily I say unto you, I knew not this man, therefore I replied: 'Who the fuck are you?'
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;20 'Ah shit dude, you forgot? I'm Cain, bro. Ya know, the who killed that little bitchtit Abel?'
		
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;21 'I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.' And I started walking away.
		
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;22 'Dam, bro, wait up. Don't be like that. Gimme a minute. How much do ya remember?'
		
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;23 '...'
		
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;24 'Well after I killed him, execution-style, ya know, Elohim cursed me with black skin and immortality. Every black person today is my illegitimate descendant.'
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;25 'Why should you fuckin care who I am?'
		
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;26 Cain: 'Because you can do some important shit. You need to put an end to Joseph Smith before it gets out of hand.'
		
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;27 'I work alone...'
		
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;28 'I can help you.  I have developed a sick way of supplying goods and services to people like you. I know you, Chad, I have connections and I can get you weapons, drugs and shit. I can basically be your traveling black market.'
		
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;29 And it came to pass that I asked him, 'What's the catch?'
		
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;30 And Cain responded, 'Get it? "Black" market?'
		
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;31 I responded not. I am not one who deals with silliness.
		
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;32 'You just have to pay me the USDs. You shouldn't have a hard time findin and stealin some from peoples' houses. I know this land better than anyone, I can be, uh, accessible in many places.'
		
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;33 'What do you need the USDs for? To pay all that child support?'
		
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;34 'Fuck you man, I don't pay that shit. But it looks like we got an agreement. Do you want to buy/sell some shit right now?'

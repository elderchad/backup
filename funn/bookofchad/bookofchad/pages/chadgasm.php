	<h3>Prologue: A Child's Prayer</h3>
	<p style="font-size: .85em;">"Some say that heaven is far away, but I feel it close around me as I pray."<br/>- <em>Janice Kapp Perry</em></p>
	
	<p>And it came to pass that the servant of the Lord, even Joseph Smith, prayed unto me with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, which Christian denomination had the truth. Therefore, I, God, even Elohim, hath revealed myself and my Son, even Jesus the Christ, even the Savior of mankind, even He who hath died upon that cross and suffered the atonement in that garden, even at Gethsemene, unto my servant, young Joe several months before his 15th birthday. And it came to pass that I hath declared unto him that all creeds are an abomination in mine eyes, and he hath been commanded to restore my truth, and discover golden plates by the guidance of my servant Moroni, and translate them, and publish the translation, and stick them in every home. And it will come to pass that when he is older, he shall go and do many girls whom the Lord hath commanded, for the Lord giveth no girl unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may marry the thing which I hath commandeth them.</p>
	
	<h3>Chapter I: A Pillar of Light</h3>
	<p style="font-size: .85em;">"I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me"<br />- <em>Joseph Smith History 1:16</em></p>
	
	<p>And it came to pass that wo be unto thy followers, for they shall be tempted by that powerful devil, even Lucifer, even that rascal little brother of Jehova, to commit whoredoms unto their bodies and spirits, even taking of drugs, and doing of alcohol, and playing with their little factories, and frigging too muchn and blaspheming by calling thy God a whoremaster and thy Savior a bastard. And it hath been coming to pass already, and shall continue coming to pass that these temptations art the trickery of thine enemy, even the Antichrist, the angel of the bottomless pit, Lucifer's lackey, who beith named Chad. He shall create a secret combination with that legendary Bigfoot, who beith Cain, even he who hath invented murder at his brother. This Anti-Holy-Trinity shall obtain these holy artifacts to use against ye and attempt to deceive mankind.</p>
	
	<h3>Chapter II: United Order of Enoch</h3>
	<p style="font-size: .85em;">"Kirtland Anti-Banking Co."<br />- <em>Kirtland bank notes</em></p>
	
	<p>And it came to pass that I shall reveal unto you that this despicable Antichrist shall pursue you along thy search for the promised land. Thy shall encounter hurdles concerning thy flock of sheep, both financial, spiritual, and physical. Thou shalt build unto me a Temple in which I shall reveal unto you lost and/or corrupted rituals which beith necessary for thy and thine peoples' salvation. This shall cause a wave of rejoicing among thy brethren and sisters, and thy flock shall be strengthened. And it came to pass that you shall not let your guard down, for the Antichrist is in hot pursuit of thy head. He shall shift the tide of reputation of thy flock to negativity, for wickedness loves company, and He hath desire in His heart to destroy the souls of men.</p>
	
	<h3>Chapter III: Holiness to the Lord</h3>

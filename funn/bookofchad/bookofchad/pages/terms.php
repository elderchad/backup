<h3>Terms and Conditions</h3>
<h4>Terms of Website Use</h4>
<p>We're fully aware of the controversial nature of many of our products.  In fact, it's a bit of a goal of ours.  So, if for any reason, you believe you will be offended in any way, do not purchase a product that labels itself as "Mature" or "Adult Content."  We will not be held responsible for hurt feelings potentially caused by the content within this website or within our products.</p>
<h4>Conditions of Purchase</h4>
<p>We intend on offering demos of our games, which will assist you, the visitor, in your decision to purchase the product.  The demo will only be edited in scope of the entire game; the content within will not be purposefully edited to not include any content one may find offensive.  We will label our games with the appropriate content that is generally considered "offensive."</p>
<p>When a purchase is made, there cannot and will not be any refunds due to an issue of a user of the product taking offense or not liking it for any other reason.</p>
<p>It is also assumed at the time of purchase, that the customer is of legal age to be purchasing a game that is rated Mature, or that their parent or guardian has approved the purchase and they purchased it themselves.  <strong>We will not be held responsible for an underaged person purchasing a Mature rated game without consent.</strong></p>
<p>Other products, such as shirts, will be shown as they will be produced, and will not contain any more or less content on them when they are received.</p>

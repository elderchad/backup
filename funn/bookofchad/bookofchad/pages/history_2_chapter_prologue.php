	<p style='text-align: justify;'>Chad continues his sacred journey after the tumultuous end of the first journey. He has been sucked into a Heavenly vortex which has spat him out on the ground of Jerusalem. He finds himself in the company of some Super Smitties. But wary ye not, he hath friends in Laban before Super Smitty Extraordinaire Nephi beheads him. Thou shalt not kill (unless thou shalt).</p>

		<h2>PROLOGUE</h2>
		<p><em>
		Chad embarks on a different kind of journey. He is introduced to ancient Jerusalem, and finds himself traversing lands not unlike in ancient Zelda games. About 600 B.C.

		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;2 Joseph reading the Bible in his home, James 1:5 - 'if any of you lack wisdom...' and a spark of confidence lights his face. <a title='"...reading the Epistle of James, first chapter and fifth verse, which reads: If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him."' style='cursor: pointer;'><code>JSH 1:11</code></a>
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;3 During a quiet, cloudless spring morning, Joseph enters a grove to plead to God for answers. <a title='"So, in accordance with this, my determination to ask of God, I retired to the woods to make the attempt. It was on the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty."' style='cursor: pointer;'><code>JSH 1:14</code></a>
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;4 A thick dooming darkness quickly surrounds young Joseph, binding his tongue. <a title='"...when immediately I was seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me, and had such an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak. Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction."' style='cursor: pointer;'><code style=>JSH 1:15</code></a>
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;5 Joseph pleads emotionally for God for a time and the darkness subsides.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;6 Two personages of immense brightness warp down to a hover over the grove floor.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;7 Jesus Christ is introduced by Elohim, and surprises young Joseph by telling him that all of these churches were an abomination to him.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;8 Joseph learns with great surprise that the truth will be restored through him.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;9 He comes to himself again, lying on his back and tired as all batshit. He goes home to start the deal yo.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;10 Young Joseph receives persecution after claiming that God has spoken to him.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;11 The Angel Moroni visits the young prophet, seer and revelator in the night. He is told a brief history of his people, ending with the Lamanites defeating the Nephites. Joseph is to find and translate the records of Moroni's people written upon Golden Plates.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;<mark>12 The Golden Plates are obtained from a large room which includes piles of other metal records, the Sword of Laban, Moroni's Breastplate, Urim and Thummim and the Liahona.</mark>
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;13 Martin Harris is selected as the scribe of the plates.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;14 God is super fussy when Martin Harris borrows the first 116 pages of the translation of the Book of Lehi. Joseph is commanded to instead translate from the Book of Nephi.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;15 The translation completes and Joseph returns the Golden Plates to the Hill Cumorah, never to be seen again.

	<h3>The Big Leagues</h3>
	<p>The Big Leagues is comprised of the world's -ONLY- original trio.  Blake and Chester worked at the same place and conceived the world's -ONLY- text file.  Stretching out across more than half of a million words over 3 years, "JordanReadMmmk" has earned the title of the world's funniest read.  It birthed the most adorable babies (BadGasm, ChadGasm, countless songs, commercials and other hilarious jokes) and some of the most deformed mistakes in the form of fussiness, insults and drama.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Blake</h3>
	<p>This programmer's dad is as charismatic as Barack Obama.  He is almost the same size as LeBron.  He is The Big Leagues GOAT.  Just don't try to guard his sweaty body in the paint.</p>
</div>
	<div id="histcategory2">
	<h3>Chester</h3>
	<p>In charge of the designs, artwork and stories of The Big Leagues' catalogue.  Just don't play Silversun Pickups when he's around.</p>
	<h3>Bandit</h3>
	<p>Growing up in a small, overwhelmingly-Mormon town, with a religious authority figure at the head of his household pulling the strings of the doctrination machine with a ferocity rarely seen, this beautiful man made himself acquainted with Kenny at an early age.  Yet to know it at the time, their friendship would blossom to emerge as a beacon against the powers that be, united by the common struggles of their guilt-ridden youth.  Intelligent with no hint of superiority and well-dressed and handsome with no sense of shallowness, this kind soul and his wonderful music is a precious pearl within The Big Leagues, Inc.  Just don't buy a car from him.
	</p>
	<p>This handsomely unshallow gentleman is in charge of the soundtracks for The Big Leagues.  Just don't buy a car from him.</p>

<h3>Website Security</h3>
<h4>Users of the site</h4>
<p>You do not need to input any information to view any of the content on this site.  We only collect information if a purchase from the store is made, and it is not stored in our database.</p>
<h4>Staff &amp; Administrators</h4>
<p>Administrators can add information to the site.  If a purchase is made in the site, the credit card information is not saved into the database and is therefore unable to be viewed by anyone, including the staff and administrators of The Big Leagues.</p>
<h4>Security policy</h4>
<p>We do not allow saving of personal details, and only necessitate them at the time of a purchase.  These details will not be saved into our database.</p>
<p>Administrators are the staff at The Big Leagues.  They have access to the website information and content, but do not have access to visitors or customers of the site.</p>
<h4>Updating &amp; Backing up</h4>
<p>Our information is backed up regularly.  Access to the database and the information within is limited to administrators by having it password protected.  All administrator passwords are encrypted.</p>

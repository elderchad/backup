		<h2>CHAPTER 1</h2>
		<p><em>
		Chad wakes up in a mysterious place. He goes in to Palmyra, and returns to the cave to get the Sword of Laban and the Golden Plates. He hears murmurs about Joseph Smith. He then heads towards Kirtland in hot pursuit. He meets Cain. A.D. 1830.
		</em></p>
		<p>
		Chad: 'What the fuck... Where am I?... I feel like shit...'
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;2 I awoke within an underground cavern. It was light as day inside, and I saw the glisten of a variety of wonderful treasures. Among them the Golden Plates, Breastplate, Liahona, and Sword of Laban.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;3 Greed was within my heart, but when I attempted to obtain these treasure for my own, I came to realize I was unable to obtain them. I needed sustenance.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;4 And it came to pass that I exited the cave, avoiding the dangers within.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;5 When I found a path to the sunlit surface, the beauty thereof was a figurative and literal breath of fresh air.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;6 And it came to pass that I found a dwelling within shouting distance of the cave. And the inhabitants thereof called this dwelling Palmyra.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;7 The inhabitants harbored ill-will towards a local boy by the name of Joseph Smith. This boy enraged the inhabitants with claims of speaking with God and translating a new scripture.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;7 And I shall record the things which the inhabitants of Palmyra spoke of.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;7 NPC 1: 'Will you destroy Joseph Smith and put an end to this nonsense?' A dark voice spoke from within me saying if I do not accept this, I shall surely perish on the spot and have to start my journey over.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;7 NPC 2: We already chased Joseph out of town. I hear he and his followers are settling in Kirtland. Find him there and destroy him for us. We will give you anything you wish if you do this for us.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;7 NPC 3: This Smith fellow is a bit out of his mind. Isn't it a bit curious that he was a treasure-hunter?
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;7 NPC 4: We all want answers to the big questions, but Joe's answer is odd...
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;7 It's not even original! Someone else wrote about that exact same theory of the origin of the Native Americans before him!
		<br />
		
		
		
		
		
		&nbsp;&nbsp;8 Within the homes I found what was sought. The coffee and cigarettes boosted my energy and provided nourishment to my soul.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;9 And it came to pass that I, Chad, went back to the cave to obtain those glorious treasures for my own.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;10 Young Joseph receives persecution after proclaiming that God has spoken to him.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;11 The Angel Moroni visits the young prophet, seer and revelator in the night. He is told a brief history of his people, ending with the Lamanites defeating the Nephites. Joseph is to find and translate the records of Moroni's people written upon Golden Plates.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;12 The Golden Plates are obtained from a large room which includes piles of other metal records, the Sword of Laban, Moroni's Breastplate, Urim and Thummim and the Liahona.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;13 Martin Harris is selected as the scribe of the plates.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;14 God is super fussy when Martin Harris borrows the first 116 pages of the translation of the Book of Lehi. Joseph is commanded to instead translate from the Book of Nephi.
		<br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;15 The translation completes and Joseph returns the Golden Plates to the Hill Cumorah, never to be seen again.

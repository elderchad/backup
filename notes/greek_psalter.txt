Greek Psalter incident (1842)

Willard Richards
"Sometimes Mr. Smith speaks as a prophet, and sometimes as a mere man. If he gave a wrong opinion respecting the book, he spoke as a mere man."

Henry Caswall
"Whether he spoke as a prophet or as a mere man, he has committed himself, for he has said what is not true. If he spoke as a prophet, therefore, he is a false prophet. If he spoke as a mere man, he cannot be trusted, for he spoke positively and like an oracle respecting that which he knew nothing."

This Greek manuscript of the Psalter, written upon parchment, is probably about six hundred years old.

"You brought this to the right place to get it interpreted, for none on arth but the Lord's prophet could explain it, or unfold its real antiquity and value."
